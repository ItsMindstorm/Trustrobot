Trustrobot, the web app that filters your news to only bring reliable news sources! Due to how the app fetches news, you have to install MAMP, otherwise the app will not be able to fetch news and not run!
This is due to the fact that I am using the free version of the newsapi at newsapi.org with the paid version, you would be able to run the app from anywhere and anytime.

How to use:
1) Clone this repository
2) Install MAMP
3) Take the html, css and png files out of the folder and drop it into the folder used by MAMP (C:\MAMP\htdocs)
4) Start MAMP
5) Start the MAMP local servers
6) Click on "Open WebStart page"
7) On the webstart page, click on "My Website"
